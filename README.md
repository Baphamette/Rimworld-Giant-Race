# Rimworld-Giant-Race
A simple race of giants for RimWorld.
A xenohuman of titanic proportions and unknown origins, about twice the size of a baseline human. Likely created as a race of soldiers or perhaps some freak science experiment. Very strong, but dim-witted and unconcerned with civilized life. Most prefer a nomadic life traveling with herds of large animals such as mammoths. Those who do settle down prefer to live underground, carving out huge cave complexes, especially in warm climates. They are very hairy with a thick layer of fat, insulating them well from the cold, but leaving them susceptible to fire and heat. Despite their large size, they don't mind the relatively cramped spaces on their own, but they do require their own personal quarters or else be left to sleep outside.
Giants are about twice the size of baseline human colonists, which incurs a number of benefits and drawbacks.
- They can both take and deal a huge amount of damage, even without weapons and armor. However, armor and weapon usage is highly restricted to large weapons and loose-fitting clothes. Compatibility for the Vanilla Expanded series is provided. Examples of clothing include tribalwear, capes, and coats. Examples of weapons include spears, pila, greatbows, battleaxes, grenades, and miniguns.
- Mine and farm twice as fast as humans, but their brutish and imprecise approach tends to result in a lower yield.
- Need twice as much food to survive. They also eat twice as fast and can eat whole corpses without becoming unhappy, so don't worry about them eating all day, but do watch out for food poisoning.
- Do most work at an overall slower rate due to their large hands getting in the way.
- Walk at a slower speed due to their cumbersome bipedal frame (the bigger they are...).
- Research much more slowly due to their simple minds and primitive culture.
- Too big for beds, so can sleep outside and on the ground with no penalty. Rests more quickly to compensate.
Half-giants are also included, of course being midway between giants and humans.
ReGrowth - Extinct Animals Pack is required for their mammoth livestock. I'll look into substituting other mammoth mods in the future (e.g. Megafauna).
I recommend playing without Giddy-Up! or restricting usage to an animal's master until I find out a way to keep them from using mounts.
